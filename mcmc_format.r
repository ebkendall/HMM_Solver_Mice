# This is where we will load the time series and clean the data such that it 
# is formatted in the way that we want. In other words, for every 5 seconds,
# we will have a time measure, and then four proportions for the different times
# as well as the different states. My next question is how to deal with time 
# periods with overlapping states, but we will address that later
